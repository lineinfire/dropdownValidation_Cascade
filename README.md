# dropdownValidation_Cascade

I made few changes on fetch_state.php to check if the SQL is working or not. I had no emp_view field, so I remvoed it to make the file working.

On index.php, I had to add cdn for jquery and bootstrap. Also I added a new jquery script at the very end of the file to validate the cascading dropdown.
